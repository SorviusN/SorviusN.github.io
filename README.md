# Taskaway

Project Name: 
Taskaway.io 

Team: 
Jona Brown

Description: 
This project was created to assign tasks to other people, along with yourself. The intention is to be held accountable for your tasks with others (chores, daily goals, e.t.c.) and feel accomplished when you've done all of your tasks for the day. The simple calendar area is just to track what day the tasks were completed. The eventual goal for the project is to create tasks for a specific day, and to be able to set timers for the specific task at hand.

Problem domain: 
This program is meant to provide accountability solutions for getting tasks finished. The uniqueness comes from the ability to assign other people tasks if you're in a leader role. You are also able to view other people's tasks to track their own progress.

Libraries:
Taskaway.io uses a google fonts API. Besides this, no other libraries or frameworks are used. Only standard HTML, CSS, and JS.
